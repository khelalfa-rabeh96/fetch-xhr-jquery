This repo covers making asynchronous requests from unspplash api for images and New York Times for articles  using three different methods:

the XHR object
jQuery's .ajax() method
the Fetch API

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for branch:

master : XHR Object
ajax-with-jquery: jQuery's .ajax() method
fetch-api-request : the Fetch API
